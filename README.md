# Overview

This is my first program using the Java language with the intent of learning the basics of the language. 

This program consists of one file containing a single class with the sole purpose of printing the line "Hello World!" to the terminal.

# Development Environment

This program was created using VS Code using the Java programming language. I used the Microsoft Extension Pack for Java in VS Code to get started and built from there.
